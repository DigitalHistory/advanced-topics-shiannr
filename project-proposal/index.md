<h3> Introduction </h3>

 My digital history project proposal will be based on the events that occurred during the second World War. World War 2 has always been an extremely interesting topic for me, and although none of my family has personally been involved during the war, my grandfather would always tell me stories about what it felt like to be alive during the second world war and how his experiences shaped the rest of his life. I have many friends who have had family directly partake in the war, have been victims or even just bystanders who lived through the trauma, heartache and joy during and after the war, in which their stories always sparked my interest. The holocaust has always been something that has intrigued me in terms of questioning how such an atrocity was able to take place in the world, as well as the reasoning behind the soldiers who were a part of the Nazi Party and committed heinous crimes. Therefore, this project will focus on the lives of the soldiers in the Nazi Party, specifically those placed in *Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp* in Austria, where their stories, letters, audio files can all be kept in one website with easy access. Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp was one of the largest camps built by the Nazi regime. It was a hub of camps built around the town of Mauthausen and Sankt Gusen which was in upper Austria. The camp operated from the moment that Austria was annexed into the German Third Reich on the 8th of August, 1938 and was not closed until the 5th of May, 1945[^1]. Mauthausen began as a small camp and eventually expanded, becoming one of the largest camps in German occupied Europe. This concentration camp was essentially the same as all the others that were built after, focusing on slave labour and extermination, however this camp had sub camps which included quarries, munitions factories, mines and arms factories amongst several others[^2]. It was also the last to be liberated by the allies as well as being the second to be built. This camp, unlike many others, contained several upper class, educated people who were put into slave labor usually resulting in death. This website intends to answer the questions that many people have about the real feelings of the soldiers that were working for the camp; How did they feel? Were there times they wanted to give up and help the prisoners? Did they believe they were doing the right thing? These kinds of questions have often been left unanswered due to fear of telling the truth. Therefore, by creating a place where we can see, hear and read the stories of the individual soldiers who worked at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, will be beneficial to uncovering a lot of truths about the Holocaust, the infamous Nazi regime and their brainwashing tactics. Digital history methods will play an important role in showcasing the information in manner that is organized and easy to understand, especially in regards to the oral aspect of this project. This project will require a *large grant* to be successful.

<h3> Method </h3>

There a plethora of tools that can be used to make this project successful and stand out amongst the rest of the projects available on the holocaust. These include Omeka, MediaKron and SoundCloud. However, I believe that for this project Omeka will be the best way to curate the research and present it in a succinct, easy-access manner for historians, students, scholars or just world war two enthusiasts hoping to find a digital archive of information on Nazi soldiers. Omeka is a tool that was created by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. It is a platform that is used for creating and displaying digital archives and exhibits. Omeka will allow me to include more than just text and media, but also combine oral history with some spatial history aspects. My research is going to be based mainly on gathering information from existing holocaust museums, but also to go further than that and attempt to get in contact with families whose parents, grandparents or even great-grand parents were part of the Nazi army that were involved in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. This is going to be a serious challenge to overcome due to the scope of this research. To contact the families of soldiers who were in this camp will take an incredible amount of time and effort, because one would have to trace the family history and figure out whether they have any remaining family members alive, if so do they speak the English and would we need to translate their work. Also their willingness to contribute may be problematic, as it might trigger traumatic or personal memories which some people will not want to share. It would also require finding ways of keeping the information in one place, in terms of keeping track of who has been interviewed, who has provided us with information and if they will be sending physical pictures, letters or any material assets associated with their relations, in which case these would need to be scanned or put into files of each person. To ensure that all the information gathered would be kept in an organized manner would be to create files for each individual that this website will include, and then keeping those files up to date with the ongoing stream of information that is found on that specific soldier. The way in which I plan to disseminate this information is through the platform of Omeka, which is used by several historians and scholars. Not only is Omeka a free platform, which will help with the budget, it is also very credible and hosts an enormous amounts of digital history projects. The only other concern with Omeka will be that since it is such a large platform, it might be difficult to stand out from all the other existing projects, and therefore it is important to reach out to different holocaust and World War 2 museums and have them promote this project as part of their showcases.

<h3> Timeline </h3>

This project will require a minimum of three to five years just purely for research. This is mainly due to the fact that a lot of the work requires attempting to find family members of soldiers who works at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, who are willing to speak about their families. Many are scared to reveal what their family members have done even after so many years, due to the nature of the research. First my research assistants and I will need to find out how many soldiers worked at Mauthausen-Gusen. We will then need to classify these men under what rank and order they served in. Following this, we will need to see which ones are dead and which ones are alive so that we can contact either their families, or them directly. This will allow to narrow the scope of research, as I will then continue to split the work between the six research assistants. Two of the assistants will work on finding information on the living soldiers, whilst three of the researchers will gather information from the families. There will be more researchers allocated to finding out about the soldiers who have passed, as there is more work required in terms of locating the families and then getting in contact with them, noting down the information about their relative, as well as finding out ways to collect any letters, audio clips or memoirs from these soldiers. The aim is to complete all the research and gather all the material in a time frame of two and half to a maximum of three years. This will give us at least two years to digitize these items if they are not already, and then create an exhibit on Omeka, or if decided to create our own platform. However, Omeka seems to be the most reasonable and cost-efficient way of promoting the project. Once we have gathered all the information, it will be a case of figuring out how to sort out the soldiers. I believe the best way to do this would be to create the ranks of the Nazi army, then within those have the pictures of the individual soldiers, and within the pictures, have all the information related to the particular soldier. Therefore if any historian, scholar or just a person of interest wanted to find out the stories of the soldiers, this would be a more methodical and organized structure. Since I am requiring at least five years to do this, the research on the soldiers who are alive need to be prioritized and finished within the first year to year and half so that we can gather as much information as possible.

<h3> Importance </h3>

This kind of research is very important in understanding the true nature of the people involved in the Holocaust and World War two. There are many things that we fail to understand, especially when it comes to the soldiers involved in the Nazi Army. Our assumption, which is valid, is created by all the negativity that we have read regarding the Nazi Army. However, sometimes we find it difficult to realise that soldiers were fighting this inner moral and ethical battle within themselves, which they found extremely daunting to come to terms with. Therefore, the premise of this project is to uncover the stories, feelings and agendas of soldiers who were a part of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Some were inherently evil and believed in what Adolf Hitler preached about, which made their stories even more interesting, because one wonders how much one has to condition their brains into believing that all the happenings in the concentration camps were not a violation of human rights, especially when it comes to the extermination of human lives. Many of these soldiers have justifications for why they did, what they did. Typically, they would place the blame on Hitler, and claim that if they did not follow orders they would be killed, and so instead of sacrificing their lives which they thought held more importance, they ended up killing thousands of innocent people. At the same time, there were soldiers who were forced into the army, and were in extremely threatening situations, not only for themselves, but for their families. These cases are very sad to hear about because these soldiers genuinely seemed helpless and hated their jobs. Usually these were the lower class ranked soldiers, because the upper ranked soldiers were on a power trip and believed that nothing would bring them down. The reason this digital history project would be important in a broader historical conversation is because we often don’t read what happened during world war two from the soldiers perspectives. It seems to be more weighted towards the actual events that happened, but not exploring the point of view of the soldiers. Further, Nazi soldiers are all grouped as being terrible humans who have violated countless human rights laws, in which many of them are, however sometimes we do not get the full story of what they felt during the time. I thought that focusing on the soldiers from one concentration camp would be a more reasonable start in this project, rather than being too broad, which would not only take a significantly longer time to gather the research and digitize it, but also would prevent the personal aspect of these soldiers to be highlighted. Historians, scholars and interested individuals will be able to use this project to help them with research as well as gain perspective on the war through the lives of the Nazi soldiers at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.

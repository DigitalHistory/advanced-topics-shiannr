# The Creation of The Mass Rapid Transport System (MRT)


Singapore, a country that gained independence only 53 years ago, is pushing boundaries with their public transport systems. Their most credible one being the Mass Rapid Transport (MRT), which is the main railway system in the country. The first station was built in November 1987 and has exponentially grown to 119 stations country-wide[^1]. Transport systems are incredibly important in countries like Singapore, where the population is increasing daily, but space is limited. The mainland of Singapore measures 50 kilometres from east to west and 27 kilometres from north to south with 193 kilometres of coastline[^2], which in comparison is only double the size of Downtown Toronto. Therefore, the country faces many problems regarding transportation and road congestion, which the government hoped to solve by creating public transport systems in order to decrease the number of cars on the road. These stations were built with the intention of not only reducing cars on the roads, but also to increase people living in more suburban areas to come to the city and find employment. However, when Singapore was developing, the government created a  centralized business district and as a result, low income earners were forced to move further away from the city center[^3]. The biggest problem that these low-income earners faced was the fact that employment was higher in the city center, and therefore travelling to the business districts was imperative to earn a living. The solution, according to the Singapore Government, was to build world-class transportation systems that were not only efficient but provided transport for low-income earners to travel to and from the city in an affordable manner. This paper aims to explore the historical nature of the MRT system in Singapore and the effects it has had on low income earners living outside the city center. Furthermore, by highlighting the geographical proximity of the stations built near suburban areas in more recent years, demonstrates the action taken by the Singapore government to increase employment for low-income earners.

The MRT system was introduced by the government due to the increasing population size and to accommodate fast and efficient transport into the inner city and financial district. It was evident that the government had not yet thought about the outer areas of Singapore and was focusing on urbanizing the inner city. Five stations were opened on the 7th of November 1987, reaching from Ang Mo Kio to Toa Payoh[^4]. These were found in central Singapore and therefore catered to the higher-income earners. However, the next few years saw expansions towards some outer cities in the country. Additionally, Singapore housing developments that are government owned called HDB apartments were built to create affordable housing units targeted at low-income earners. HDB's however, are not generally located closely to  MRT stations, in which case one would need to take another form of public transport, a bus for example, to reach the closest MRT station. Thus, in order to get to work, low-income earners **"have to spend up to 9.8% of their household income per month and 70 min per trip from their neighborhoods to the city center."**[^5] Therefore, by creating these new stations near areas that are inhabited by mainly low-income earners, employment has increased.

Spatial History is a fairly new concept that allows historians and scholars in the humanities field to rethink the way history is viewed and analyzed. By integrating different forms of *spatial, visual* and *textual* analysis in order to create more interesting methods of research, historians are now able to conceptualize ideas in a more efficient way. We can use this method to showcase the different stations built in the suburban areas of Singapore and the political agenda behind them. This map will showcase five of the newer MRT stations that were built to accommodate for low-income earners. The first station that I will discuss is [Bedok Reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedok_MRT_station) shown on the map. The second station that was built as part of the plan to attract low-income earners was [Tampines East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampines_MRT_station). The next three stations are yet to be built, but once they are completed will allow for quick transport from these more suburban areas to the city centre. The third station which is set for completion by 2019 is [Woodland North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlands_North_MRT_station), followed by [Katong Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katong_Park_MRT_station) in 2023, and [Bedok South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedok_South_MRT_station) in 2024[^7].

# Conclusion

To conclude, the MRT in Singapore has served as an powerful tool in combatting not only congestion on roads, but more importantly providing transportation for low-income earners living in suburban areas. The government of Singapore often fails to accommodate for elderly and poor, therefore by creating these train stations, access to the city centre was provided, and more are being built in the hopes of successfully integrating the low-income workers with the opportunity to find employment at the city center, without having to face problems of time and money. The political agenda of this project is evident through the careful planning of where the next stations are going to be built in the future. The historical past of Singapore's development scheme highlights the forceful eviction of low-income earners who resided in city centers in order to create a financial district and city centre. The MRT stations that were and continue to be built in these rural areas are merely a form of compensation by the government to alleviate the anger that was rising amongst many of the low-income earners. Therefore, the spatial element in the paper that showcase the MRT stations that have been built as well as three future stations yet to be built in rural areas are key to understanding the development and historical past of Singapore, and the different ways in which the government aims to increase employment within the nation.
